## Description

The website is a satire news platform designed for entertainment rather than serious reporting. It caters to individuals who enjoy reading news-style articles with a humorous twist. Suitable for users who appreciate witty social commentary, exaggerated headlines or lighthearted takes on current events. This site provides an engaging escape from traditional news.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project was to design a website on a topic of interest while showcasing the skills and techniques learned during weeks 1 to 6 of the module.

### Personal Goals

My goal with the project was to test myself with the limitations given in the design specification and have try to have fun at the same time.

## User Experience (UX)
### Target Audience

**Casual readers** – People who enjoy browsing fun and lighthearted content for entertainment.

**Fans of satire and parody** – Those who appreciate comedic takes on current events and media.

**Social media users** – Individuals who like sharing humorous news stories and engaging with satirical content online.

**Comedy enthusiasts** – Readers who enjoy creative storytelling, sarcasm, and absurd humor.

**Skeptical news consumers** – Those who find traditional news overwhelming and prefer a more humorous approach to information.

## Design

### Color Scheme

The color scheme for this project was inspired by Sky News. The primary colors used include deep black (#252525), a vibrant blue (#2aa2e1), and an even darker black (#111). These colors were directly sourced from Sky News to maintain a similar visual identity.

Using the darker black taken from Sky News, a complementary palette was taken from Coolors to enhance contrast and vibrancy.

The extended selection includes:
- Jade Green (#44af69),
- Imperial Red (#f8333c),
- Icterine Yellow (#fffd82),
- Ultra Pink (#f26df9).

![Coolors Palette](/documentation/assets/imgs/palette.png)

These colors were chosen to add energy and visual interest while maintaining a professional aesthetic.

The decision to incorporate blue was influenced by its common use in news and social media platforms, symbolizing trust, reliability, and strength qualities essential for a news-oriented website. The additional colors were selected to create contrast and draw attention to key elements to ensure a dynamic and engaging user experience on *The Daily Satire*.

### Typography


For typography, I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to select a font that would provide a clean and readable experience for users. I chose **Roboto** because of its modern sans-serif design that ensures excellent readability on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Core Components

#### Breadcrumb paths
![Breadcrumb](/documentation/assets/imgs/breadcrumb.png)

**Breadcrumb Paths** - As part of my independent learning, I built a simple breadcrumb component using NunJucks. This component is implemented on the news and entertainment pages and could be expanded in future iterations with JavaScript to enable multi-level traversal on subcategory pages.

While my current approach works, I acknowledge that using JavaScript could provide a more efficient, modular, and reusable solution. Future improvements may focus on simplifying the implementation and enhancing functionality.

#### Navigation System

![Navigation System 1](/documentation/assets/imgs/nav-system-1.png)

The navigation system was designed with the intent of making it as easy as possible to traverse the website.
THe current page is scaled slightly larger with a bottom blue border to indicate the current page.

Using NunJucks template logic I was able to modify the nav-items template to add 'active' class.

```html
<li class="nav-item {{'active' if page.url == '/' }}"><a href="/" aria-label="link to home page">Home</a></li>
<li class="nav-item {{'active' if '/about' in page.url }}"><a href="/about" aria-label="link to about us page">About</a></li>
<li class="nav-item {{'active' if '/entertainment-and-arts' in page.url }}"><a href="/entertainment-and-arts" aria-label="link to entertainment and arts page">Ent & Arts</a></li>
<li class="nav-item {{'active' if '/latest-news' in page.url }}"><a href="/latest-news" aria-label="link to latest news page">Latest News</a></li>
<li class="nav-item {{'active' if '/contact' in page.url }}"><a href="/contact" aria-label="link to contact page">Contact</a></li>
```

On smaller screens the navigation system show cases the hamburger menu animation and collapse functionality, implemented using only HTML and CSS.

#### Container System

With time and effort the entire website was structured using Flexbox and CSS Grid. Inspiration for naming conventions and column sizing was taken from Bootstrap but the container system was built entirely from scratch through trial and error.

Container System:

![Container System](/documentation/assets/imgs/container-system.png)

I intentionally designed the container class to utilise Flexbox. It allowed for efficient spacing and content wrapping across web pages. Grid was used within the row class to position elements inside the containers. Additionally, I created helper classes such as justify-content-center to promote code reuse and maintain consistency.

Common breakpoints were set using min-width for a mobile-first approach. Through this project, I re-learned and solidified my understanding of the differences between min-width and max-width. Initially, the layout was broken and visually unappealing, but with research and testing, I determined that min-width was the appropriate media query for column responsiveness. The defined breakpoints are 1024px, 767px, and 300px.

The grid system utilises a 12 column layout with a minimal gap of 0.5rem.

Grid System:

#### Inline Styling
The articles for news and entertainment were modified using nunjucks to cover the images over part of the containers holding them.

```html
{% macro field(title, description, date, url, imgSrc, size)%}
<article class="{{size}} pb-4 m-2">
    <a href="{{url}}" class="text-white text-decoration-hover">
        <div style="width:100%;height:160px;background: url({{imgSrc}}) center center;background-size:cover"
            class="rounded shadow-hover"></div>
        <div class="m-2">
            <p class="py-2 fw-light fs-5">{{title}}</p>
            <p class="py-2 fw-light">{{description}}</p>
            <p class="py-2">{{date}}</p>
        </div>
    </a>
</article>
{% endmacro %}

```

#### Responsive Design

As shown at the start of the **README** the website utilises the container system I built to provide a responsive website across mobile, tablet and desktop screens.


## Data

The data on the webpages is primarily embedded using NunJucks. In future versions this could be enhanced by utilising JSON, JavaScript, or a database to replace the need for embedded data.

The embedded data consists of arrays, objects, and primitive values.

## Testing

## Development & Deployment

### Version Control

I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a local repository and IDE & [GitHub](https://github.com/) as a remote repository.

1. Firstly, I needed to create a new repository on Github [web-dev-setu-1](https://github.com/KristianColville1/web-dev-setu-1).
2. I opened that repository on my local machine by copying the URL from that repository and cloning it from my IDE for use.
3. Visual Studio Code opened a new workspace for me.
4. I created files and folders to use.
5. To push my newly created files to GitHub I used the terminal by pressing Ctrl + shift + `.
6. A new terminal opened and then I used the below steps.

    - `git add (name of the file)` *This selects the file for the commit*
    - `git commit -m "Commit message: (i.e. Initial commit)"` *Allows the developer to assign a specific concise statement to the commit*
    - `git push` *The final command sends the code to GitHub*

### Cloning this Repository

If you would like to clone this repository please follow the bellow steps.

Instructions:

1. Log into GitHub.  
2. Go to the repository you wish to clone.  
3. Click the green "Code" button.  
4. Copy the URL provided under the HTTPS option.  
5. Open your preferred IDE with Git installed.  
6. Open a new terminal window in your IDE.  
7. Enter the following command exactly: `git clone the-URL-you-copied-from-GitHub`.  
8. Press Enter.

### Netlify

I used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deploying my project.

1. First, I created an account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
2. I then connected my GitHub repository to Netlify by clicking the "New site from Git" button on the dashboard.
3. I selected GitHub as my provider and authorized Netlify to access my GitHub account.
4. I chose the repository I wanted to deploy from the list of my available options.
5. I made sure to specify the build command and publish directory. This project utilises the **_site** directory for static build.
6. After confirming the settings, I clicked "Deploy site."
7. Netlify then started building and deploying the project, and once finished, it provided a URL for accessing the live site.

Netlify also automatically set up continuous deployment. Any new changes pushed to the repository will trigger a new deployment on Netlify.
